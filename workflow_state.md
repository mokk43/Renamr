# Workflow State

## Status
`COMPLETE`

## Plan
Build MVP for Txt Character Renamer per AGENTS.md:
- PySide6 GUI with file selection, name extraction, 2-col editable table, replace/export
- Strict <16KB UTF-8 chunking with paragraph preservation
- Serial LLM calls with ≥2s cadence
- Config persistence via platformdirs + keyring

## Log
- Scaffold created: pyproject.toml, README, package structure
- Core modules: io.py, chunking.py, llm_client.py, name_extract.py, replace.py, config.py
- UI modules: main_window.py, settings_dialog.py, models.py, workers.py
- Tests: chunking, parsing, cadence, replacement, I/O
- QA: All acceptance criteria verified, lint-free, .gitignore added

## Acceptance Criteria Verification
- [x] Can select and load `.txt` reliably (handles encoding errors gracefully)
- [x] Splits into ordered chunks, each strictly <16KB UTF-8 bytes
- [x] Calls OpenAI-compatible model serially, one chunk per request, ≥2s between requests
- [x] Dedupe merges extracted names into a list shown in a 2-column editable UI
- [x] Only edited mappings are replaced; export file name follows `*_processed` rule
- [x] LLM settings + prompt persist and auto-load on startup
